The files GetOpt.{cc,h} are from the GNU libg++ software package. If you'd
like the complete library it may be obtained from ftp.gnu.org.

The files GNURegex.{cc,h} were originally from teh GNU libg++ package, but 
I rewrote them to use the Unix regex library some time ago. 

The files outbuf.h and .cc are from Nicolai Josuttis' "The C++ Standard
Library" and are not part part of libg++. I use these to build a pipe that 
can be written to using an ostream object.
